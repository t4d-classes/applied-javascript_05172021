# Exercise 6

1. Create a new component named Car Edit Row. Car Edit Row is the same as Car View Row, except the columns for make, model, year, color and price are input fields.

Populate the edit row input fields with the data for the car when the row is shown.

The [formGroup] does not have to be applied to a form element. It can be applied to any element.

2. In the last column of Car Edit Row, display (but do not implement) a Save and Cancel buttons.

3. In the Car View Row, add an Edit button to the actions column. When the button is clicked, that row changes to an edit row. Only ONE row is editable at a time. Design your data structures accordingly. Do not support multiple edit rows in your data structure.

4. Ensure it works.
